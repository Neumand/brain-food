# Personal OKRs - 2021 (June)

## Objective 1: Improve writing and mental health through daily self-reflection

### Key Results

1. **Write 750 words every day**. This daily activity combines several of my previous challenges into one: writing consistently, journaling, and meditating. Writing 750 words per day is not easy. It's a challenging process that will force me to bring light to the things that have been going on in my life. It will also make me a better writer. I have struggled previously with traditional forms of meditation. While I hope to explore that form some day again, I'd like to focus on combining all of these elements together in a cohesive way. Focus on less things but do them better.

## Objective 2: Make a more conscious effort to accelerate my career growth

### Key Results

1. **Write 2 technical blog posts**. There is still a month left before the end of the quarter. This is one objective that can easily be salvaged with focused effort.

2. **Spend 3 hours per week with one of my side projects**. These include one of the following:

    * Personal blog rebrand
    * Habit tracking application
    * Rich-text editor
## Objective 3: Spend my time more productively

### Key Results

1. **Eliminate League of Legends from my gaming time**. This game took up the vast majority of my mental space for the greater part of May. I constantly sought to play this game as much as possible and it was not good for my mental health. While I will occasionally opt to play video games with friends or to enjoy single-player, narrative experiences, I will not be playing this game.

2. **Weekly iPhone Screen Time: (Kindle + Newsletter App) > YouTube**. I recently downloaded the Kindle app on my phone to reduce the time that I've spent watching entertaining videos on YouTube. I want to replace some of this usage with reading.

3. **Workout 6x/week**
