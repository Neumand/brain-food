## Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

> Bits are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Inside the computer, they take forms such as a high or low electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, or a shiny or dull spot on the surface of a CD. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

Modern computers have more than 30 billion bits in its working memory. We separate them into chunks - called **values** - so that we can represent the bits without getting confused.

JavaScript uses 64 bits. This translates into 2^64 different numbers (18 quintillion). Meaning, we can use 64-bit chunks freely without worrying about memory overflow.
