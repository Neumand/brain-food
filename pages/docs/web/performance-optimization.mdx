# Performance Optimization

## 3 Keys to Performance

1. Improve client-side performance
2. Improve file transfer over the wire (i.e. network latency)
3. Improve backend processing

Focus on the most important potential performance bottlenecks first.

## Frontend Performance

### Critical Render Path

### Optimized Code (Code Splitting)

### Progressive Web App

## File Transfer

### Minimize Files
Minimizing the file size of the different files that we ship to the browser will improve the performance of a website. We can reduce the file size for:

**Text**. JS, CSS and HTML files.

**Images**

Image optimization is more difficult, but it's a common reason for bloated websites.

- **JPG**: complex images
- **PNG**: limit number of colors that you can use and are smaller in size than JPGs; good for logos
- **SVG**: vector graphics; designers work with on Adobe, Sketch, etc; you can expand an SVG to several times its size and it will retain its details; can be customized with CSS
- [**WEBP**](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp): similar to PNG but superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web
- [**AVIF**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF): better compression efficiency than JPG as well as better detail preservation

### Minimize Delivery

## Backend

### CDNs

### Caching

### Loading Balancing

### DB Scaling

### GZIP
