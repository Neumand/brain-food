# TypeScript Fundamentals

## Type Categories
- **Nominal**. Typing is based on the "name" of something. The type system cares about the name of the class it originates from (Java, C++, C#, etc.)
- **Structural**. Type system only cares about the structure or the shape of the object (TypeScript). TS is a structural system so that it can be incrementally adopted to JS, a dynamically typed language.

### Union Types

A union type represents the OR operator. It's technically related to Set theory, but for the purposes of learning TS no need to understand that.

```typescript
const outcome: "success" | "error";
```
