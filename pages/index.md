# Brain Food

Brain food is:
* A newsletter by Farnam Street's Shane Parrish
* One of my favorite Spotify playlists for focus and concentration

It's now also the name of my personal wiki. The brain food you will find here is a collection of information on software development, writing, productivity, and anything else worth remembering.

Don't forget to chew. Enjoy your food.
